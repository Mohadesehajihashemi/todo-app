# CS50 Final Project: To-Do List Web App | نظرات کاربران

## Description
This project is a **To-Do List Web App** designed for users to add, view, and delete comments. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this app allows users to interact with a list of comments. It uses **localStorage** to persist data across page reloads, ensuring comments remain visible after refreshing the browser.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how web applications can manage user-generated content using client-side storage. This app can be particularly useful in blog systems, websites with user feedback, or any platform that requires comment management without relying on server-side databases.

With this simple app, users can engage with content by adding their thoughts and easily removing unwanted comments. This app is a perfect example of how client-side storage works and how JavaScript can manipulate DOM elements dynamically. It also provides a base for future feature enhancements such as user authentication, likes/dislikes, or filtering comments based on categories.

## Features
- **Add Comments**: Users can enter comments and they will be displayed on the page.
- **Persistent Storage**: The comments are saved to **localStorage** so that even after a page reload, the comments remain visible.
- **Delete Comments**: Each comment has a "Delete" button that allows users to remove it from the list.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is simple to use and features a clean, easy-to-navigate design.
- **Responsive**: The app works across different screen sizes, making it accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser (no server required).
3. To add a comment, simply type your comment into the input box and click the "Add Comment" button.
4. The comment will appear in the list below.
5. To remove a comment, click the "Delete" button next to it.
6. The comments will persist even after you refresh the page because they are saved in **localStorage**.

## Future Features
In future versions of this app, I plan to add:
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to sign in before leaving comments.
- **Like/Dislike System**: Let users like or dislike comments.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Enable sorting of comments by date or category, and allow users to filter comments based on keywords or sentiment.
- **Comment Editing**: Add the ability for users to edit their comments after posting them.
