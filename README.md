# CS50 Final Project: To-Do List Web App | نظرات کاربران

This project is a simple web application that allows users to add, view, and delete comments. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application uses **localStorage** to save comments so that they persist even after the browser is refreshed. This project serves as a simple demonstration of how web applications can interact with local storage and allows users to engage with the content by adding and removing their feedback.

## Features
- **Add Comments**: Users can add their comments to the list.
- **Delete Comments**: Each comment can be deleted by the user.
- **LocalStorage**: Comments are saved in the browser's **localStorage** so they persist after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Add comments in the input field and click the 'Add Comment' button to see your comment appear on the list.
4. You can delete any comment by clicking the 'Delete' button next to it.
5. Refresh the page, and the comments will still be visible since they are saved in localStorage.

## Future Features
In the future, I plan to add features such as:
- **User Login and Registration**: Allow users to log in and manage their comments.
- **Like/Dislike System**: Let users like or dislike comments.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Implement sorting and filtering options for the comments.
